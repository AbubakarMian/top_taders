explain this api and its result


Explanation of the Response
slot: 275138101 - The Solana blockchain slot number at which this transaction was included. Slots are a measure of time on the Solana blockchain.
blockTime: 1719871314 - The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the block containing this transaction was confirmed.
txHash: 37rbfbSYqwvMxjxEwZfRzyVQPw8cnUe7JVr5ms2wLp726rWm1eLWi1wNEKmfG4JHdQERxiX3dnKrGQCVM6RPWM5d - The unique identifier (hash) of the transaction.
src: 4BUbWZFDiFqwoJf4q6BbDEc2ongsGgum2bJq2kMpycgL - The source (sender) Solana account address for the transfer.
decimals: 9 - The number of decimal places used for the token. In the case of SOL, this is 9, indicating the smallest unit is called a "lamport."
dst: AK1XpdPmHhjvbjRyY1uiY3qoaCPEKFSjwSZuEgKeL2t - The destination (receiver) Solana account address for the transfer.
lamport: 1 - The amount of SOL transferred, in lamports. Since there are 1 billion lamports in one SOL, this value represents a very small amount of SOL.
status: Success - The status of the transaction, indicating that it was successfully processed and confirmed.
Summary
This API call retrieves SOL transfer transactions for a specified Solana account, providing detailed 
information about each transaction, such as the slot number, timestamp, transaction hash, source and 
destination addresses, amount in lamports, and transaction status.
txHash: This is indeed the transaction signature. In Solana, a transaction signature (often referred to as txHash) uniquely identifies a transaction and can be used to retrieve all details about that transaction from the blockchain.
{account}: This refers to the wallet address. It is the public key associated with a Solana wallet, used to identify the account on the blockchain.
